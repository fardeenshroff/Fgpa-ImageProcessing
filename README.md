💡 FPGA Design

📌 Directory: fpga_design/

📌 Modules Implemented:

📌 Design Tools:

Synthesis & Simulation: Xilinx Vivado / Intel Quartus Prime

Target FPGA: (Specify your FPGA model here)

🔹 Software Validation (OpenCV)

📌 Directory: opencv_testing/

📌 Script: opencv_sobel.py

📌 Purpose: Process identical images using OpenCV to validate and compare against FPGA results.

📌 Key Functions:

Edge Detection: Sobel Operator

Noise Reduction: Gaussian Blur

Histogram Equalization: Contrast Adjustment


Python Code for Edge Detection (opencv_sobel.py)

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load image
image = cv2.imread('image_input/test.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply Sobel Edge Detection
sobel_x = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=3)
sobel_y = cv2.Sobel(image, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=3)
sobel_combined = cv2.magnitude(sobel_x, sobel_y)

# Save output
cv2.imwrite('image_output/sobel_result.jpg', sobel_combined)
cv2.imshow('Sobel Edge Detection', sobel_combined)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
